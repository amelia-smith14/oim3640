## My Project Proposal

**What I'm building:** I am building a grade calculator.
**Why I chose this:** I often am looking to compute my grade averages and see how different results on assignments could impact my course grade or GPA.
**Core features:** Accept a grade for each assignment, accept a weight for each assignment, calculate course grades,accept previous course grades and credit amounts, recalculate GPA.
**What I don't know yet:** How can I add something that will tell you the grade you need on an assignment to get a certain letter grade in a course? I am worried about having to handle multiple loops at a time and using all of the statements properly.
