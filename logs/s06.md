# Session 6 (2/5)

## What I learned today
Today we reviewed variables, expressions, statements, and functions. We then moved into emojis, which can be used to draw shapes in Python. We also incorporated loops in this to draw shapes with less lines of code and turned our code into functions.

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
def draw_square(size):
    for i in range(size):
        print("🧱"*size)

draw_square(3)

Draws a square. 

## Challenges I faced
I am still getting used to the idea of intendation and how to use it properly, as well as the use of colons at the end of lines in loops.

## AI usage (if any)
None today.

## Questions for next time
How will we use mutable/immutable types in the future?
