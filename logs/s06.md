# Session 6 (2/5)

## What I learned today
Today we reviewed variables, expressions, statements, and functions. We then moved into turtle, which can be used to draw shapes in Python. We also incorporated loops in this to draw shapes with less lines of code and turned our code into functions.

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
def rhombus():
    make_turtle()
    for i in range(4):
        forward(50)
        left(120)
rhombus()

Draws a rhombus. 

## Challenges I faced
[What was difficult? How did I approach it?]

## AI usage (if any)
[What I asked AI for, how I used/modified the output]

## Questions for next time
How will we use mutable/immutable types in the future?
