# Session 1 (1/20/26)

## What I learned today
Today we familiarized ourselves with the course and its structure, as well as diving into developing an app with the purpose of generative AI. We did this by identifying pain points faced by ourselves and others, and considering how an app might be able to solve this. 

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
I haven't written any code yet, and I would probably fail at explaining what it does.

## Challenges I faced
I wasn't sure if I was giving ChatGPT the correct prompt because I wasn't sure how to explain I wanted an app developed in Python and if I needed to provide any additional parameters.

## AI usage (if any)
As I mentioned, we used AI (either ChatGPT or Replit) to create an app to solve our issue. I was not able to run this code because we ran out of time, and I would not have known how to run it anyway.

## Questions for next time
I'm used to running R code in RStudio, what software will we be running our Python code in? Will the app we quickly developed today be run or connect to a larger project, or was it more of a thought exercise?
