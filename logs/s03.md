# Session 3 (1/26) - [Asynchronous]

## What I learned today
[Brief reflection on key concepts; focus on understanding, not just syntax]

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
[Paste a snippet and explain what it does]

## Challenges I faced
[What was difficult? How did I approach it?]

## AI usage (if any)
[What I asked AI for, how I used/modified the output]

## Questions for next time
When I go to commit and push my changes, it asks me to type in a commit message. As of now, I have just been typing "commit", but is there something else I should be writing that is a better practice?
