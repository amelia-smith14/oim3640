# Session 3 (1/26) - [Asynchronous]

## What I learned today
The beginning of first chapter felt pretty familiar as it was more about programming in general and I was able to find similarities from my work with R as far as basic calculations and operations. I also learned about the different types of variables in Python and how they can be changed. The second chapter also seemed to have similar themes to how R is used with slight differences, like using a = instead of <- and modules/packages. I think these chapters were a good introduction to working with Python and made me feel more comfortable.

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
Getting the required notebooks downloaded to my repository.

## Challenges I faced
This is not something I faced today, but it is a challenge I think I might run across in the future. I think pivoting from the variable types and and functions that I am used to in R might be difficult to switch from since I have been using them for a while.

## AI usage (if any)
I did not use AI today.

## Questions for next time
When I go to commit and push my changes, it asks me to type in a commit message. As of now, I have just been typing "commit", but is there something else I should be writing that is a better practice?
