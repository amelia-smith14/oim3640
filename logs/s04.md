# Session 4 (1/29)

## What I learned today
Today we learned how to access the Jupyter notebooks that we downloaded last class. This allows us to run code from within the textbook to practice. I also got a better feel of how to use Command Prompt and PowerShell as we ran some code in there.

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
The notebook we were working on today involved basic operations, like 2+2. The code itself is simple, but I was happy to get a better feel of using the notebooks and coding within them.

## Challenges I faced
I struggle a bit with what to do when first opening Command Prompt and PowerShell as I am not always sure what to type or how to correctly access the folders I need.

## AI usage (if any)
None today.

## Questions for next time
Should all of our readings be done in the Jupyter notebooks with us completing the exercises as we go rather than just looking at the textbook webpage?
