# Week 6 (2/24 + 2/26)

## What I learned today
On Tuesday, we began by reviewing what we had done in previous classes and going over some review questions on topics like count, keywords (break and continue), and for vs while loops. We then moved onto strings and some of the principles of this type of variable. We also reviewed how strings cannot be adjusted, but instead a new string must be made, as well as various basic string methods. On Thursday, we began class with a quiz on these topics and then worked on using the AI copilot to help us with our projects through the Ask, Plan, and Agent modes.

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
[Paste a snippet and explain what it does]

## Challenges I faced
I have not used AI embedded in my work like this before, so it is a bit unfamiliar to constantly have it making suggestions as I work. However, I know this will be extremely helpful and improve my efficiency once I have adjusted to it.

## AI usage (if any)
I used the copilot a lot to help work on my project.

## Questions for next time
Are there limits on how we should be using the copilot for assignments like projects? Are there similar copilots for other coding langauges, like R?
