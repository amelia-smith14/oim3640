# Week 4 (2/10 + 2/12)

## What I learned this week
We worked on drawing shapes using the turtle module, as shown in Chapter 4 of the textbook. We did this by creating functions for different shapes and having the turtle move forward and turn by different amounts.

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
[Paste a snippet and explain what it does]

## Challenges I faced
Turtle was working for me in the Jupyter notebook when I was running through the practice problems in the text, but when I try to run it in a Python file I do not see the shapes appear.

## AI usage (if any)
[What I asked AI for, how I used/modified the output]

## Questions for next time
[What remains unclear?]
