# Week 4 (2/10 + 2/12)

## What I learned this week
We worked on drawing shapes using the turtle module, as shown in Chapter 4 of the textbook. We did this by creating functions for different shapes and having the turtle move forward and turn by different amounts. On Thursday, we reviewed the mini projects we will be completing during the semester. We reviewed concepts found in Chapters 5 and 6 like the return command, conditionals, and recursion.

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
def draw_square(turtle_obj, size = 100):
    """Draw a sqare with given size."""
    for i in range(4):
        turtle_obj.forward(size)
        turtle_obj.left(90)

This uses the turtle module to draw a square with a side length of 100.

## Challenges I faced
Turtle was working for me in the Jupyter notebook when I was running through the practice problems in the text, but when I try to run it in a Python file I do not see the shapes appear.

## AI usage (if any)
I used AI to help understand conditional statements like elif better and how they work.

## Questions for next time
Are there any limits on how we should be using AI for our projects in this class?
