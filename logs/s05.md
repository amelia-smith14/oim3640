# Session 5 (2/3)

## What I learned today
I learned how to create documentation to explain what functions we are defining are doing using triple quotation marks. This helps us learn from previous functions and can help AI understand what we are trying to do. We also reviewed topics like variable types.

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
def groundhog_day():
    """A function that prints 'groundhog day' every second indefinitely."""
    print('Did you mean: groundhog day?')
    time_sleep(1)
    groundhog_day()

## Challenges I faced
Thinking about defining my own functions is new to me because when I was working in R, I would only use predefined functions. However, I think the idea of writing my own functions is exciting and creates a lot of new opportunities.

## AI usage (if any)
None today.

## Questions for next time
I am still struggling with saving my Jupyter notebooks. When I complete the exercises and go to commit the changes, I get an error message that there is nothing to commit. Is there something I am doing wrong or some way that saving Jupyter notebooks differs from saving learning logs?
