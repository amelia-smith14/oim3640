# Session 2 (1/22)

## What I learned today
Today I got a better understanding of the softwares and platforms we will be working with, as well as how we will be organizing and structuring the work we do. I also learned about version control, which I think will be helpful to keep better track of my coding.

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
I was happy to get my repository set up and organized with the README as well.

## Challenges I faced
I was a bit confused about committing and pushing changes at first, but after I reviewed the process a couple of times I understood.

## AI usage (if any)
I did not use AI today.

## Questions for next time
I still see .gitattributes and .gitignore in my repository under my folders for things like code and data. Is this normal and should I be seeing this, or is there something else I need to do to eliminate them from this view?
